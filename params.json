I mainly use PHP as my backend and scripting languages but I like to expand my knowledge to new Web languages like NodeJS, Python & Ruby on Rails. \r\n\r\nMy Frontend design work is done using LESS, Im also used to work with Bootstrap or Foundation grid to make websites faster and clean. I really like to design and make random websites for customers or friends. \r\nI also want to learn more about responsive and modern webdesign because it's something you never have enough knowledge on.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Checkout my Github here\r\n[My Github link](https://github.com/4rv1d)\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n",
